# Configure-Multiple-Cisco-Switches
This Python script uses the Netmiko library to configure multiple Cisco switches via SSH. Specifically, the script logs in to each switch in a list of IP addresses provided in a text file, enters the commands to create a standard access-list, permits a specific IP address, saves the configuration, and logs out.
